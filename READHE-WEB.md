Originally created by  @Icecovery, was maintained by  @flywlyx, he hasn't updated it for a year., thread is here:  https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/179556-17x-comfortable-landing-continued-v161/.  As usual, if @flywlyx returns, I'd be happy to return control to  him.

I was asked to adopt this, and since he didn't respond to my attempt contact, I've decided to adopt it.  See below for my changes

Comfortable Landing can keep your Kerbals safe and feel comfortable even in the last minute of a mission!

It adds retro rockets, buoys, and airbags into stock command pod and command pod of other mod.

And they will automatically deploy when certain conditions are met.
